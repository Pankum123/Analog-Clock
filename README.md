ðŸ“Œ Analog Clock

The Analog Clock project visually represents time with hour, minute, and second hands. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it updates in real-time using JavaScriptâ€™s Date object. CSS transformations are used for smooth hand movements, creating a classic yet functional design. This project demonstrates creativity in combining JavaScript with CSS animations for an interactive and visually appealing output.
